grep searches the input files for lines containing a match to a given pattern list.
when it finds a match in a line, it copies the line to standard output(by default), or whatever other sort of output you have requested with options.

grep root /etc/passwd
grep -n root /etc/passwd    show line number
grep -v root /etc/passwd    donot contain root 
grep -c root /etc/passwd    get number of line contain root
